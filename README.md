DEvol
=====

Differential Evolution Experiments in R.

This is implementation of Differential Evolution (DE) Algorithm in R together with handy reporting system.
It is design to provide simple interface allowing to plan, run and analize a lot of experiments connected to DE. It also is ment to provide basic extensibility you would expect function language to provide.

Implemented DE may differ from basic definition of this algorithm as it is used also to check how some changes in algorithm are affecting it effectivenes.
